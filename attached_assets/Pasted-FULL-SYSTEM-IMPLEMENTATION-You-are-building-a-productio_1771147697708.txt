FULL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

You are building a production-grade AI-powered cold email automation SaaS platform.

This is NOT a mock app. All flows must function correctly end-to-end.

The platform must behave like a real automation engine with real integrations.

⸻

🚀 CORE USER FLOW

1️⃣ CONTACTS PAGE – CSV IMPORT (REAL FUNCTIONALITY)

When user uploads a CSV:
	•	Parse CSV file properly
	•	Validate required fields (Name, Email, Company, Role)
	•	Insert contacts into database
	•	Immediately render them inside the existing contacts table
	•	Default status = “Not Applied”

Automation must only send first emails to contacts with status:

“Not Applied”

Status must update automatically after actions.

⸻

2️⃣ CAMPAIGNS PAGE – AUTOMATION CONTROL ENGINE

Campaign Settings must include:
	•	Daily Send Limit
	•	Number of Follow-Ups
	•	Follow-Up Delay (dynamic per follow-up)
	•	Priority Mode:
	•	Follow-Ups First
	•	Fresh Emails First
	•	Balanced (ratio-based blending)
	•	Automation Start Time (NEW FEATURE)

Automation Behavior
	•	Automation must start exactly at the selected time.
	•	Stop after daily send limit reached.
	•	Resume next day automatically at selected time.
	•	Respect priority mode logic.
	•	Skip contacts marked:
	•	Replied
	•	Bounced
	•	Paused

Follow-ups must:
	•	Only be sent if previous email exists
	•	Respect configured delay
	•	Use prior email context

No follow-ups for replied contacts.

⸻

3️⃣ GMAIL INTEGRATION – REAL OAUTH FLOW

The current “Connect Gmail” button is fake.

This must be replaced with real Google OAuth 2.0.

Correct Flow:
	1.	User clicks “Connect Gmail”
	2.	Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
	3.	Request proper scopes:
	•	Send email
	•	Read message metadata
	•	Read threads
	4.	After authorization:
	•	Store encrypted access token
	•	Store refresh token
	•	Store expiry
	5.	Mark integration = Connected only after real success

Sending Emails
	•	Send via Gmail API
	•	Store:
	•	Email subject
	•	Body
	•	Message ID
	•	Thread ID
	•	Timestamp

Reply Detection
	•	Periodically check Gmail threads
	•	If reply detected:
	•	Update status = Replied
	•	Cancel future follow-ups

System must use thread ID for follow-ups to preserve context.

⸻

4️⃣ NOTION INTEGRATION – REAL OAUTH FLOW

Current logic (enter database ID + show connected) is wrong.

Correct approach:

Proper Notion Integration Flow
	1.	User clicks “Connect Notion”
	2.	Redirect to Notion OAuth authorization
	3.	User selects workspace
	4.	Store secure access token
	5.	After connection:
	•	Fetch list of databases
	•	Allow user to select database from dropdown
	•	NOT manually paste database ID

Only after successful OAuth should integration show “Connected”.

⸻

5️⃣ NOTION SYNC LOGIC

If contacts were imported from Notion:
	•	Store Notion page ID reference
	•	When status changes in platform:
	•	Update Notion page property automatically

Examples:
	•	First email sent → “First Email Sent”
	•	Follow-Up 1 → “Follow-Up 1”
	•	Replied → “Replied”

Platform is source of truth.

Status must sync:
	•	In Contacts page
	•	In Notion database

⸻

6️⃣ SETTINGS PAGE – FULL AI CONTEXT

AI must use:
	•	Full Profile Description
	•	Skills
	•	Target Roles
	•	Tone
	•	Professional Experience entries
	•	Highlight Projects
	•	Resume content
	•	Custom Prompt override

All must be saved and retrievable.

When generating emails:
	•	Combine user profile context
	•	Combine recipient company + role
	•	Light company research before generating email

Emails must feel:
	•	Personalized
	•	Context-aware
	•	Non-generic
	•	Professional

⸻

7️⃣ CONTEXT MEMORY ENGINE

System must store:
	•	All sent emails
	•	All thread IDs
	•	All timestamps

When generating follow-up:
	•	Pass previous email content into AI
	•	Maintain continuity
	•	Avoid disconnected messaging

⸻

8️⃣ STATUS RULES (CRITICAL LOGIC)

Automation must:
	•	Send first emails only to “Not Applied”
	•	Send follow-ups only to:
	•	“First Email Sent”
	•	“Follow-Up 1”
	•	etc.

Never send follow-ups to:
	•	Replied
	•	Bounced

Status must auto-update after each action.

⸻

9️⃣ SYSTEM EXPECTATIONS
	•	Secure token storage
	•	Background job scheduler
	•	Daily automation cycle
	•	Clean modular architecture
	•	No fake UI-only logic
	•	No simulated integrations

Everything must function end-to-end.

⸻

⚠️ CRITICAL FIX

Replace fake “Connect” buttons with real OAuth implementations.

Simply toggling “Connected” in UI is unacceptable.

Integrations must only show “Connected” after:
	•	OAuth success
	•	Token stored
	•	API verified

⸻

🎯 FINAL GOAL

User uploads CSV
→ Connects Gmail
→ Connects Notion
→ Sets automation time
→ Clicks Start Automation
→ Emails send automatically
→ Follow-ups reference prior emails
→ Replies cancel automation
→ Status syncs to Notion
→ System runs daily

Fully automated.

⸻

🔥 IMPORTANT

This must be built as a real SaaS automation system.

No mock logic.
No placeholder connections.
No fake connected states.

Everything must work properly.

⸻

Now to answer your direct question:

Is entering a Notion database ID and clicking connect correct?

No.

That is NOT how real integrations work.

Real integrations use OAuth authorization.
Database ID input alone is insecure and incomplete.

If Replit built it that way, it built a fake integration.

You were right to question it.
