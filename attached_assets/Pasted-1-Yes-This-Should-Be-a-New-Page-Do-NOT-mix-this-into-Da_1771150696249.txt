1️⃣ Yes — This Should Be a New Page

Do NOT mix this into Dashboard or Contacts.

Create a dedicated page:

Inbox or Conversations

Just like:
	•	Gmail
	•	Linear comments
	•	CRM inbox
	•	Sales tools (Apollo, Instantly, Lemlist)

This becomes your command center.

⸻

2️⃣ Layout Structure (Correct Way)

You were thinking correctly.

Use a 3-column layout:

LEFT SIDEBAR
	•	Contact name
	•	Company
	•	Status (Not Applied / First Email / Follow-up / Replied)
	•	Last message preview
	•	Unread badge
	•	Open rate icon
	•	Reply icon

⸻

MIDDLE PANEL

Full conversation thread:
	•	Sent emails
	•	Follow-ups
	•	Replies
	•	Timestamps
	•	Delivery / Open indicators
	•	Clean email-style UI

Looks like Gmail thread view.

⸻

RIGHT PANEL (Optional but powerful)
	•	Contact details
	•	Campaign info
	•	Email analytics:
	•	Delivered
	•	Opened
	•	Clicked
	•	Reply time

⸻

3️⃣ Email Tracking — Reality Check

Now important part.

You can track:

✅ Delivered (SMTP success)
✅ Opened (Tracking pixel)
✅ Link Clicks (Redirect tracking link)
✅ Replies (Gmail webhook / polling)

You CANNOT reliably track:
❌ “Read” (Open ≠ Read)

Email tracking works like this:
	•	Add invisible pixel image in email
	•	Add tracked redirect links
	•	Store events in DB
	•	Update status

⸻

4️⃣ Architecture You Need

To support this, your system must:
	•	Store every sent email body in DB
	•	Store message ID from Gmail API
	•	Store thread ID
	•	Sync replies via:
	•	Gmail push notifications (watch API)
	•	OR polling every X minutes

Without this, follow-ups will never be intelligent.

⸻

5️⃣ Should This Be a Separate Feature?

Yes.

Add a new page:

/inbox
or
/conversations

This becomes:
	•	Email thread viewer
	•	Tracking dashboard
	•	Reply manager
	•	Status updater

⸻

6️⃣ Where Tracking Metrics Should Live

Tracking summary:
	•	Show per contact (inside Inbox)
	•	Show aggregated metrics in Analytics page

Do NOT clutter Dashboard.

⸻

7️⃣ Product Advice (Brutal Truth)

If you build:
	•	Gmail sending
	•	Thread storage
	•	Reply sync
	•	Tracking
	•	Notion sync
	•	Automation scheduler

You are no longer building a small SaaS.

You are building:

A full cold-email automation platform.

Which is:
	•	Infrastructure heavy
	•	Webhook heavy
	•	Async job heavy
	•	Database design heavy

So architect properly now or you’ll rebuild everything later.
