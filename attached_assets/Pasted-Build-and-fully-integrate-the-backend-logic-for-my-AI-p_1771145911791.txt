Build and fully integrate the backend logic for my AI-powered cold email automation SaaS platform.

This is not a demo project. This must function like a real, production-grade SaaS product.

You have already built CRUD successfully. Now implement full functional automation and integrations.

⸻

🚀 Product Overview

This is an AI-powered cold email automation platform for job seekers.

Users should be able to:
	1.	Upload contacts via CSV
	2.	Import contacts from Notion database
	3.	Connect Gmail
	4.	Generate personalized cold emails
	5.	Automatically send follow-ups
	6.	Stop follow-ups if someone replies
	7.	Sync status updates back to Notion (if imported from Notion)
	8.	Use full profile context for personalization

This must behave like a real automation engine — not just static CRUD.

⸻

1️⃣ CSV Upload – Fully Functional

Implement working CSV import on Contacts page.

When user uploads CSV:
	•	Parse CSV file
	•	Validate required columns (Name, Email, Company, Role)
	•	Store contacts in database
	•	Display them immediately in Contacts table
	•	Set default status = “Not Sent”

If CSV row is invalid:
	•	Skip row
	•	Log error
	•	Do not crash system

This must work cleanly and reliably.

⸻

2️⃣ Gmail Integration – Fully Functional

Implement proper Gmail OAuth integration.

User Flow:
	•	User clicks “Connect Gmail”
	•	Redirect to Google OAuth
	•	Request required scopes for:
	•	Send email
	•	Read replies
	•	Access thread metadata

After authorization:
	•	Store encrypted access + refresh tokens securely
	•	Mark Gmail status = Connected

Sending Emails:
	•	Send emails via Gmail API
	•	Store:
	•	Full email body
	•	Subject
	•	Gmail message ID
	•	Gmail thread ID
	•	Timestamp

Follow-Ups:
	•	Use same thread ID
	•	Generate contextual follow-up referencing first email

Reply Detection:
	•	Periodically check inbox for replies
	•	If reply detected:
	•	Update contact status = Replied
	•	Stop all future follow-ups

This must be automatic and intelligent.

⸻

3️⃣ Notion Integration – Fully Functional

User Flow:
	•	User connects Notion via OAuth
	•	User selects a Notion database
	•	Import contacts from selected database

After import:
	•	Contacts appear in Contacts page
	•	Store Notion page ID reference for each contact

Status Sync:
When status changes in platform:
	•	Update Notion database row automatically

Example:
	•	First email sent → Status = “First Email Sent”
	•	Follow-up sent → Status = “Follow-Up 1”
	•	Replied → Status = “Replied”

Changes must reflect BOTH:
	•	In platform Contacts page
	•	In Notion database

Bidirectional sync not required for now.
Platform is source of truth.

⸻

4️⃣ AI Personalization Engine

When generating emails:

AI must use:
	•	User’s full profile (from Settings page)
	•	Skills
	•	Target roles
	•	Experience entries
	•	Highlight projects
	•	Tone preference
	•	Resume content (if uploaded)

AI must also consider:
	•	Recipient’s Company
	•	Recipient’s Role

Before generating email:
	•	Fetch public context about company (light research)
	•	Use role context to tailor message

Email must feel:
	•	Context-aware
	•	Relevant
	•	Not generic
	•	Not spammy

Follow-ups must reference previous message content.

Store ALL sent emails in database for context continuity.

⸻

5️⃣ Automation Engine

Implement background job system for:
	•	Daily send limits
	•	Scheduled follow-ups
	•	Delay intervals
	•	Priority mode (Follow-ups first / Fresh first / Balanced)

Automation must:
	•	Respect daily limit
	•	Skip replied contacts
	•	Skip bounced emails
	•	Track progress

Use proper scheduling mechanism (not setTimeout hacks).

⸻

6️⃣ Contact Status Logic

Statuses:
	•	Not Sent
	•	First Email Sent
	•	Follow-Up 1
	•	Follow-Up 2
	•	Replied
	•	Bounced
	•	Paused

System must auto-update statuses based on:
	•	Email send
	•	Follow-up send
	•	Reply detection
	•	Error detection

Contacts page must reflect real-time accurate state.

⸻

7️⃣ Context Memory

Platform MUST store:
	•	All sent email content
	•	Thread IDs
	•	Message IDs
	•	Timestamps

Follow-ups must use previous email body as context input to AI.

This is mandatory to avoid disconnected emails.

⸻

8️⃣ Error Handling
	•	If Gmail token expired → auto refresh
	•	If email fails → mark failed, retry once
	•	If Notion API fails → log and retry
	•	If CSV malformed → do not crash app

System must be resilient.

⸻

9️⃣ Production-Level Expectations

This must be built like a real SaaS product:
	•	Secure token storage
	•	Clean separation of services
	•	Modular architecture
	•	Background job handling
	•	Scalable structure
	•	No fake simulation logic

No shortcuts.

⸻

🔥 Goal

When complete, the system must allow:

User uploads CSV
→ Connects Gmail
→ Connects Notion
→ Clicks Start Automation
→ Emails are sent intelligently
→ Follow-ups are contextual
→ Replies stop automation
→ Status updates sync to Notion
→ Everything works without manual intervention

This must function as a real, production-grade AI cold email automation engine.

⸻

Build it properly.

No demo logic. No placeholders.

Production-ready architecture.
