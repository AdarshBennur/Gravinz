Good. This is the right move.
You don’t need schema babysitting — you need **clear product context + architectural direction** so Replit can build it properly.

Here’s your **clean, strong backend prompt** you can paste directly into Replit AI:

# 🔥 BACKEND BUILD PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI

Build a **production-grade SaaS backend** for an AI-powered cold email automation platform for job seekers.

This is a real startup-level product, not a demo.
It must be scalable, secure, and multi-tenant from day one.

Use:

* Supabase (Authentication, Database, Storage)
* Supabase Row-Level Security for multi-tenant isolation
* Supabase Edge Functions (if needed for secure operations)
* Secure server-side email sending architecture
* Clean, modular backend structure

---

## 🧠 Product Context

This platform helps job seekers automate personalized cold emails to hiring managers and recruiters.

Users:

* Sign up
* Connect Gmail
* Upload contacts (CSV or manual)
* Configure AI tone and targeting
* Set daily sending limits
* Configure follow-ups
* Start automation

The system then:

* Personalizes cold emails using stored profile + AI prompt context
* Sends emails within daily limits
* Tracks replies
* Sends follow-ups if no reply
* Tracks analytics

This is NOT a bulk spam tool.
It is a controlled, rate-limited, behavior-mimicking automation tool.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Use Supabase Auth:

* Email/password
* Google OAuth
* Secure session handling
* Proper protected routes

Everything must be user-scoped and isolated via RLS.

---

## 🗄 Database Responsibilities

The backend must manage:

* User profile context (AI personalization data)
* Professional experience entries
* Highlight projects
* Campaign settings
* Contacts list
* Email status tracking
* Automation state (running / paused)
* Daily usage tracking
* Follow-up scheduling logic
* Analytics aggregation
* Integration statuses (Gmail / Notion)

Do NOT hardcode anything.
Everything must be stored and managed properly.

---

## ✉ Email Automation Engine

Implement a backend email engine that:

* Respects daily send limits
* Supports configurable follow-ups
* Has priority modes (Follow-ups first / Fresh first / Balanced)
* Mimics human sending patterns (randomized delays)
* Can be paused instantly
* Prevents rate limit abuse
* Handles Gmail OAuth securely

Automation must:

* Run safely
* Be interruptible
* Track send history
* Avoid duplicate sends
* Avoid sending to replied contacts

---

## 📊 Analytics

Backend must compute:

* Emails sent
* Reply rate
* Follow-up performance
* Daily usage progress
* Campaign effectiveness

All calculated server-side.

---

## 🧩 Integrations

### Gmail

* OAuth connection
* Secure token storage
* Sending emails via Gmail API
* Refresh token handling

### Notion (Optional)

* Store DB ID
* Sync contacts if enabled

---

## 🧠 AI Integration

Backend should:

* Store user AI profile context
* Generate personalized email prompts
* Support tone selection
* Allow custom prompt override
* Be ready to integrate with OpenAI API cleanly

AI calls must be server-side only.

---

## 🚀 Architecture Requirements

* Clean modular backend structure
* Separation of concerns
* Proper environment variable management
* Production-ready error handling
* Logging for debugging
* Secure secrets handling
* No hardcoded keys
* Rate limit protection
* Future scalability in mind

---

## 🏗 Goal

This should feel like a funded SaaS startup backend:

* Secure
* Clean
* Organized
* Scalable
* Multi-tenant
* Professional

No hacky code.
No fragile cron spaghetti.
No insecure token storage.

Everything should feel like something that could handle 10,000+ users.

---

Build the entire backend architecture cleanly, connected to the existing frontend, and fully integrated with Supabase for auth, database, and storage.

---

That’s it.

This gives Replit:

* Product understanding
* Architecture direction
* Constraints
* Scalability mindset
* Clear ownership of Supabase
* Clear automation logic requirements

No over-micromanaging.
No schema babysitting.
Just strategic clarity.

If you want, I can now also give you:

* A stricter version that forces proper background job handling
* Or a version optimized specifically for Supabase Edge Functions
* Or a version optimized for avoiding Gmail rate limit disasters

Your call.
